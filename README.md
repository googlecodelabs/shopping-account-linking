# Codelab for Creating and Linking AdWords and Merchant Center Accounts

This is a small codelab which goes through getting set up with the
AdWords API and the Content API for Shopping, and then shows how to use
those APIs to create and link AdWords and Merchant Center accounts.

## Prerequisites

Please make sure that you're running Java 7+. If you use Maven, you can use
the included `pom.xml` to install the required dependencies.  Otherwise,
install the [Google Ads APIs Client Library for Java](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-java-lib)
and the [Content API for Shopping Client Library for Java](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/apis/content/v2).

We assume you've checked out the code and are reading this from a local
directory. If not, check out the code to a local directory and set up the
project appropriately for access to the libraries listed above.
